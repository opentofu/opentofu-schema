        # Thank you for opening an issue.

        The [OpenTofu Schema](https://github.com/opentofu/opentofu-schema) issue tracker is reserved for bug reports relating to the core OpenTofu schema repository.

        ## Filing a bug report

        To fix problems, we need clear reproduction cases - we need to be able to see it happen locally. A reproduction case is ideally something any engineer can git-clone or copy-paste and run immediately, without inventing any details or context.

        * A short example can be directly copy-pasteable; longer examples should be in separate git repositories, especially if multiple files are needed
        * Please include all needed context. For example, if you figured out that an expression can cause a crash, put the expression in a variable definition or a resource
        * Set defaults on (or omit) any variables. The person reproducing it should not need to invent variable settings
        * Omit any unneeded complexity: remove variables, conditional statements, functions, etc. that are not needed to trigger the bug
